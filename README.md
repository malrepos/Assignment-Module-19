# Assignment-Module-19

I chose to hire "Lane" for 5.00 hours. Her hourly rate is 0.2 ether and her Ethereum address is 0xaC8eB8B2ed5C4a0fC41a84Ee4950F417f67029F0.

The total wage payable in ether is 1.0.

In the following screenshot, ganache at block 0 is shown:

Upon sending the transaction in the strreamlit interface a validated transaction hash was displayed:

Ganache at block 1 with the transaction sent and my account updated:

Here I display the expanded block 1 details:

Here I display the transaction details:

For me to display the recipients balance and history in ganache I would need to change the address of "Lane" in the candidate_database dictionary located at line 91. As this was not specified in the instructions I chose to leave the address as the default.
